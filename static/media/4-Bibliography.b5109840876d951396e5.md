Notes: Most of these resources are about the OWL verse SHACL "debate". I don't think it as much of a debate as about two different tools that have some overlapping features, but have different purposes and goals.

Notes: The official specification is probably the best way to learn SHACL. The examples are clear and well written. The SHACL in SHACL is also very helpful. The SHACL playground provides a convenient way of creating tests and data that can be used to explore how it works. The RDF Document Editor is an interesting approach to using SHACL (plus some local vocabulary) to create forms with SHACL.
